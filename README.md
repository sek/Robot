# Project Description

This project allows novice programmers to experience a quick and easy start to programming. An example of a very simple program is as follows:

    import Robot;
    
    public class RobotExample
    {
    
	    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException
	    {
		    Robot rob = new Robot();
		    rob.setSpeed(5);
		    rob.penDown();
		    rob.move(100);
		    rob.turn(90);
	    }
    }


This program will bring up a window with the image of a robot in it. The robot moves 100 points while drawing a line, turns 90 degrees, and stops. With small variations, the programmer can make the robot make more intricate movements and draw more intricate patterns. `RobotExample1` and `RobotExample4` show examples slightly more complex. These examples also illustrate the use of for-loops.

A robot can also be controlled via the keys on the keyboard by adding a `KeyboardAdapter`. `RobotExample2` is a very small program, which lets the user control the robot via up, down, left and right arrow key presses. `ExtendedKeyboardAdapter` shows an extension of `KeyboardAdapter` that adds further commands that can be invoked through the key presses. In `RobotExample3`, the use of `ExtendedKeyboardAdapter` is illustrated. This example also shows how to use any image as the robot image.

More than one robot can be added to the window, which is illustrated by `RobotExample5`. This example also shows how to make the robots run simultaneously by letting the robots run in different threads. 

`RobotExample6` shows how to control two robots separately from the keyboard using `ShiftKeyboardAdapter`s. When the user holds down the shift key, one robot reacts to the key events, otherwise the other robot reacts to the key events.

If a user wants to teach a `Robot` new tricks, it is possible to extend the `Robot` class and add new methods and/or override existing ones. This is illustrated by `MyRobot`, which can draw regular polygons. The usage is shown in `RobotExample8`. Alternatively to extension, composition may be used. The class `Driver` has a `Robot` instance and commands to the `Driver` instance are delegated to the `Robot` instance. The usage is illustrated by `RobotExample9`. As one can see, `RobotExample8` and `RobotExample9` are almost identical.

Robots don't necessary have to move in straight lines. `RobotExample11.java` illustrates the use of `quadTo()` and `cubicTo()` to make robots move along quadratic and cubic paths. `RobotExample12.java` illustrates the command `followPath()` that takes a `PathIterator` as argument.
